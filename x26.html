                    <h2 id="design_overview">Overview</h2>
                    <p>In CCSM3/cpl6, all components ran as separate executables and there was no concept of a top-level
                        driver.
                        The components started independently and then communicated to the coupler at regular intervals
                        via
                        send and receive methods called directly from within each component. The coupler acted as a
                        central
                        hub coordinating data exchange, implicitly managing lags and sequencing, and executing coupler
                        operations such as mapping (interpolation) and merging.</p>

                    <p>CCSM4/cpl7 is now built as a single executable with a single high-level driver. The driver runs
                        on all processors and handles coupler sequencing, model concurrency, and communication of data
                        between components. The driver calls all model components via common and standard interfaces.
                        The
                        driver also directly calls coupler methods for mapping (interpolation), rearranging, merging, an
                        atmosphere/ocean flux calculation, and diagnostics. In CCSM4, the model components and the
                        coupler
                        methods can run on subsets of all the processors. In some sense, the cpl6 sequencing and hub
                        attributes have been migrated to the driver level while the cpl6 coupler operations like mapping
                        and merging are being done as if a separate coupler component existed in CCSM4. In other words,
                        cpl7 consists of a driver that controls the top level sequencing, the processor decomposition,
                        and communication to components through subroutine calls while coupler operations such as
                        mapping and merging are running under the driver on a subset of processors as if there were a
                        unique coupler model component.</p>

                    <p>CCSM4 consists of both data and active components models. In general, an active component both
                        needs data from and provides data to the coupler while data models generally read data from I/O
                        and then just provide data to the coupler. In CCSM4, like CCSM3, the atmosphere, land, and sea
                        ice models are always tightly coupled to better resolve the diurnal cycle. This coupling is
                        typically half-hourly, although at higher resolutions, coupling can be more frequent. The ocean
                        model coupling is typically once or a few times per day. The diurnal cycle of ocean surface
                        albedo is computed in the coupler for use by the atmosphere model. The looser ocean coupling
                        frequency means the ocean forcing and response is lagged in the system. There is an option
                        in CCSM4 to run the ocean tightly coupled without any lags, but this is normally used only when
                        running with data ocean components.</p>

                    <p>Depending on the resolution, hardware, run length and physics, a CCSM4 run can take several hours
                        to several months of wall time to complete. Runs are typically decades or centuries long, and
                        the
                        model typically runs between 1 and 50 model years per wall clock day. CCSM4 has exact restart
                        capability and the model is typically run in individual one year or multi-year chunks. CCSM4 has
                        automatic resubmission and automatic data archiving capability.</p>

                    <h2 id="design_seq">Sequencing and Concurrency</h2>
                    <p>In CCSM4, the component processor layouts and MPI communicators are derived from namelist input.
                        At the present time, there are seven (7) basic processor groups in CCSM. These are associated
                        with the atmosphere, land, ocean, sea ice, land ice, coupler, and global groups, although others
                        could be easily added later. Each of the seven processor groups can be distinct, but that is not
                        a requirement of the system. A user can overlap processor groups relatively arbitrarily. If all
                        processors sets overlap each other in at least one processor, then the model runs sequentially.
                        If all processor sets are distinct, the model runs concurrently. The processor sets for each
                        component group are described via 3 basic scalar parameters at the present time; the number of
                        mpi tasks, the number of openmp threads per mpi task, and the global mpi task rank of the root
                        mpi task for that group. For example, a layout where the number of mpi tasks is 8, the number of
                        threads per mpi task is 4, and the root mpi task is 16 would create a processor group that
                        consisted of 32 hardware processors, starting on global mpi task number 16 and it would contain
                        8 mpi tasks. The global group would have at least 24 tasks and at least 48 hardware processors.
                        The driver derives all MPI communicators at initialization and passes them to the component
                        models for use.</p>

                    <p>As mentioned above, there are two issues related to whether the component models run
                        concurrently. The first is whether unique chunks of work are running on distinct processor sets.
                        The second is the sequencing of this work in the driver. As much as possible, the CCSM4 driver
                        sequencing has been implemented to maximize the potential amount of concurrency of work between
                        different components. Ideally, in a single coupling step, the forcing for all models would be
                        computed first, the models could then all run concurrently, and then the driver would advance.
                        However, scientific requirements such as the coordination of surface albedo and atmosphere
                        radiation computations as well as general computational stability issues in CCSM4 prevent this
                        ideal implementation. Figure 1 shows the maximum amount of concurrency supported by the current
                        CCSM4 driver implementation for a fully active system. In practice, the scientific constraints
                        mean the active atmosphere model cannot run concurrently with the land and sea-ice models.
                        Again, figure 1 does not necessarily represent the optimum processor layout for performance for
                        any configuration, but it provides a practical limit to the amount of concurrency in the system
                        due to scientific constraints. With CCSM4, results are bit-for-bit identical regardless of the
                        component sequencing because the scientific lags are fixed in CCSM4 by the implementation, not
                        the processor layout.</p>

                    <h2 id="design_interfaces">Component Interfaces</h2>
                    <p>The standard CCSM4 component model interfaces are based upon the ESMF design. Each component
                        provides an init, run, and finalize method with consistent arguments. The CCSM4 component
                        interface arguments currently consist of Fortran and MCT datatypes, but an alternative ESMF
                        version is also available. The physical coupling fields are passed through the interfaces in the
                        init, run, and finalize phases. As part of initialization, an MPI communicator is passed from
                        the driver to the component, and grid and decomposition information is passed from the component
                        back to the driver. The driver/coupler acquires all information about resolution,
                        configurations, and processor layout at run-time from either namelist or from communication with
                        components.</p>
                    <p>
                        Initialization of the system in CCSM4 is relatively straight-forward. First, the seven MPI
                        communicators are computed in the driver. Then the atmosphere, land, ocean, sea ice, and land
                        ice models' initialization methods are called on the appropriate processor sets, and mpi
                        communicator is sent, and grid and decomposition information are passed back to the driver. Once
                        the driver has all the grid and decomposition information from the components, various
                        rearrangers and mappers are initialized that will move data between processors, decompositions,
                        and grids as needed at the driver level. No distinction is made in the coupler implementation
                        for sequential versus concurrent execution. In general, even for cases where two components have
                        identical grids and processor layouts, often their decomposition is different for performance
                        reasons. In cases where the grid, decomposition, and processor layout are identical between
                        components, the mapping or rearranging operation will degenerate to a local data copy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The interface to the components' run method consists of two distinct bundles of fields. One is
                        the data sent to force the model. The second is data received from the model for coupling to
                        other components. The run interface also contains a clock that specifies the current time and
                        the run length for the model. These interfaces follow the ESMF design principles.
