                    <p>
                        CCSM4 supports both CCSM-designed coupling interfaces based on MCT
                        datatypes and ESMF coupling interfaces based on the ESMF design.
                        In both cases, a top-level driver calls init, run, and finalize methods
                        for each gridded component. The primary and default method for running
                        CCSM4 is with the MCT-based interfaces and an ESMF library is not
                        required in that case.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        ESMF interfaces are supported via translation methods that are
                        instantiated in the <tt>models/drv/shr_esmf</tt> directory. These methods
                        translate between the datatypes in the MCT interfaces and the datatypes
                        in the ESMF interfaces. In the current CCSM4 ESMF interface implementation,
                        the top-level driver still calls the init, run, and finalize component
                        methods using the MCT interfaces. That interface does not match the
                        ESMF interface provided by the gridded components. To facilitate
                        translation, each component provides an additional layer where the
                        MCT interfaces are translated to the ESMF interfaces and data is
                        copied between datatypes on entry and exit of each method. The translation
                        of MCT to ESMF datatypes and vice versa is supported via the shared
                        source code in the <tt>models/drv/shr_esmf</tt> directory. In the future, the
                        CCSM4 driver could be modified and the ESMF interfaces called directly
                        thereby eliminating the extra translation layer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All CCSM4 components support both MCT interfaces and ESMF interfaces
                        at the top level independently. This is specifically implemented using
                        two distinct directories of source code to separate the interfaces,
                        so one or the other can be compiled with the component model. These
                        directories exist in all components and are generally called <tt>cpl_mct</tt> and
                        <tt>cpl_esmf</tt>. The <tt>cpl_mct</tt> directory contains the MCT coupling interface.
                        The <tt>cpl_esmf</tt> directory contains the ESMF coupling interfaces as well as
                        the additional translation layer. At the present time, these interfaces
                        are maintained independently and modifications within any of the
                        interface methods will likely require modifications to the alternative
                        interface for consistency.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To use the ESMF interfaces, the ESMF version 4 release library
                        must be installed locally and the <tt>USE_ESMF_LIB</tt> environment variable
                        must be set to <tt>TRUE</tt> in the <tt>env_build.xml</tt> file. In addition,
                        the <tt>COMP_INTERFACE</tt> value in <tt>env_build.xml</tt> must be set to <tt>ESMF</tt>.
                        When those variables are set, components compile the source code
                        in <tt>cpl_esmf</tt> instead of <tt>cpl_mct</tt> and the ESMF library is linked to
                        the CCSM executable.
                        Support of the ESMF interfaces is a relatively new feature in CCSM4.
                        Results using either interface are bit-for-bit identical
                        for several configurations tested, and validation of the implementation
                        is ongoing.
