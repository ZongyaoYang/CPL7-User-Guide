                    <h1><a name="implementation_bfb">The bit-for-bit (BFB) Flag</a></h1>
                    <p>
                        There is a bit-for-bit flag in the CCSM drv_in namelist called
                        <a href="x371.html#nmlv_bfbflag">bfbflag</a>. This flag modifies some
                        coupler computations to preserve bit-for-bit results on different
                        coupler processor counts. This flag has no impact on other components
                        and their ability to generate bit-for-bit results on different pe counts.
                        When this flag is set, all mappings become "X" types where the source
                        data is rearranged to the destination processor and then local mapping
                        is carried out. The order of operations of this mapping is independent
                        of the pe count or decomposition of the grids. The
                        other feature that is changed by the bfbflag is the global sum diagnostics.
                        When the bfbflag is set to false, a partial sum is done on each
                        processor and those partial sums are added together to form a global
                        sum. This is generally not order of operations independent for different
                        pe counts or decompositions. When the bfbflag is set, the global sums
                        are computed by gathering the global field on the root processor and doing
                        an ordered sum there.
