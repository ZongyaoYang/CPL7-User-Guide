                        <p>
                            This guide covers the CCSM4 top level driver implementation
                            as well as the coupler component within the system. The driver
                            runs on all hardware processors and basically runs the top
                            level instructions and executes the driver time loop. The
                            coupler is a component of the CCSM4 system that is run from
                            within the driver. It can be run on a subset of the total processors,
                            and carries out mapping (interpolation), merging, diagnostics,
                            and other calculations. The name cpl7 refers to the source
                            code associated with both the driver aspects and the coupler
                            component aspects. cpl7 code is located in the CCSM4 source
                            tree under models/drv/ and the main program of CCSM4 is
                            models/drv/driver/ccsm_driver.F90.

                            This document provides a general overview of the cpl7 design. Then
                            specific implementation issues are discussed individually. Finally,
                            there is a section summarizing all of the cpl7 namelist input. This
                            document is written primarily to help users understand the inputs and
                            controls within the cpl7 system, but to also provide some background
                            about the associated implementation.
