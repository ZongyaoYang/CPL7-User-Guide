                    <p>
                        The standard implementation for grids in CCSM has been that the
                        atmosphere and land models are run on identical grids and the
                        ocean and sea ice model are run on identical grids. The ocean
                        model mask is used to derive a complementary mask for the land
                        grid such that for any given combination of atmosphere/land
                        and ocean/ice grids, there is a unique land mask. This approach
                        for dealing with grids is still used a majority of the time in
                        CCSM4. But there is a new capability, called
                        <a href="x91.html#implementation_trigrid">trigrid</a>, that allows
                        the atmosphere and land grids to be unique. A typical grid in
                        CCSM4 is named something like 1.9x2.5_gx1v6 which is the finite
                        volume "2 degree" atmosphere/land grid matched with the gx1v6
                        "1 degree" ocean/ice grid. This also has a shortname of f19_g16.
                        The "out-of-the-box" supported grids, compsets, and machines in
                        CCSM4 are generated automatically by running
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Historically, the ocean grid has been the higher resolution grid in CCSM.
                        While that is no longer always the case, the current implementation largely reflects
                        that presumption. The atmosphere/ocean fluxes in the coupler are computed
                        on the ocean grid. A new namelist input which is not yet validated called
                        <a href="x371.html#nmlv_aoflux_grid">aoflux_grid</a>
                        will allow the user to specify the atmosphere/ocean flux computation grid
                        in the coupler in the future. In addition, the mapping approach used in
                        CCSM4 also reflects the presumption that the ocean is generally higher
                        resolution. Fluxes are always mapped using a locally conservative area average
                        methods to preserve conservation. However, states are mapped using bilinear interpolation
                        from the atmosphere grid to the ocean grid to better preserve gradients, while
                        they are mapped using a locally conservative area average approach from the
                        ocean grid to the atmosphere grid. These choices are based on the presumption
                        that the ocean grid is higher resolution.

                    <p>
                        There has always been an option that all grids (atmosphere, land, ocean, and ice)
                        could be identical, and this is still supported. There are a couple of
                        namelist variables, <a href="x371.html#nmlv_samegrid_ao">samegrid_ao</a>,
                        <a href="x371.html#nmlv_samegrid_al">samegrid_al</a>, and
                        <a href="x371.html#nmlv_samegrid_ro">samegrid_ro</a> that tell the coupler
                        whether to expect that the following grids; atmosphere/ocean, atmosphere/land,
                        and runoff/ocean respectively are identical. These are set automatically in the driver
                        namelist depending on the grid chosen and impact
                        <a href="x91.html#implementation_mapping">mapping</a> as well as

                    <p>
                        A new feature in CCSM4 allows the atmosphere and land grids to be unique.
                        One example in the CCSM4 scripts is the ne30np4_1.9x2.5_gx1v6 (ne30_f19_g16)
                        grid. This grid configuration consists of the ne30np4 homme grid for the
                        atmosphere, the "2 degree" grid for the land, and the "1 degree" grid for the
                        ocean/ice. Note that the trigrid implementation has undergone a reasonable
                        amount of testing, but as of April, 2010, it is still considered a relatively
                        new feature and continues to undergo careful scrutiny.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The trigrid implementation introduces an ambiguity in the definition of
                        the mask. This ambiguity is associated with an inability to define an
                        absolutely consistent ocean/land mask across all grids in the system.
                        A decision was made in CCSM4 to support the trigrid as follows. The
                        land mask is defined on the atmosphere grid as the complement of the
                        ocean mask mapped conservatively to the atmosphere grid. Then the land
                        and ocean masks are exactly complementary on the atmosphere grid where
                        conservative merging are critical.
                        No precise land fraction needs to be defined in the land grid. The only requirement
                        is that the land model compute data on a masked grid such that when
                        mapped to the atmosphere grid, all atmosphere grid points that contain some
                        fraction of land have valid values computed in the land model. There
                        are an infinite number of land fraction masks that can accomplish this
                        including a fraction field that is exactly one at every grid cell.
                        In the land model, all land fraction masks produce internally conservative
                        results. So there is no problem with conservation in the system with
                        this approach with one caveat. The runoff model in the clm active land
                        model is run on a unique half degree grid. In order to interpolate the
                        land forcing data for the runoff grid, a land fraction mask that is consistent
                        with the ocean mask in the system is required. To support the land to
                        runoff mapping in clm, the land fraction on the atmosphere grid is
                        conservatively mapped to the land grid in the coupler and sent to the
                        land model for use. This field can then be used with the land fraction
                        field from within clm to generate properly scaled runoff forcing which is
                        also conservative.

                    <p>
                        The component grid fractions in the coupler are defined and computed in CCSM4
                        in models/drv/driver/seq_frac_mct.F90. A slightly modified version of the
                        notes from this file is pasted below. Just to clarify some of the terms.
                        fractions_a, fractions_l, fractions_i, and fractions_o are the fractions
                        on the atmosphere, land, ice, and ocean grids.
                        afrac, lfrac, ifrac, and ofrac are the atmosphere, land, ice, and ocean
                        fractions on those grids. So fractions_a(lfrac) is the land fraction on
                        the atmosphere grid. lfrin is the land fraction defined in the land model.
                        This can be different from lfrac because of the trigrid implementation.
                        lfrac is the land fraction consistent with the ocean mask and lfrin is the
                        land fraction in the land model. ifrad and ofrad are fractions at the last
                        radiation timestep. These fractions preserve conservation of heat in the net
                        shortwave calculation because the net shortwave calculation is one timestep
                        behind the ice fraction evolution in the system. When the variable "dom"
                        is mentioned below, that refers to a field sent from a component at initialization.

!  the fractions fields are now afrac, ifrac, ofrac, lfrac, and lfrin.
!    afrac = fraction of atm on a grid
!    lfrac = fraction of lnd on a grid
!    ifrac = fraction of ice on a grid
!    ofrac = fraction of ocn on a grid
!    lfrin = land fraction defined by the land model
!    ifrad = fraction of ocn on a grid at last radiation time
!    ofrad = fraction of ice on a grid at last radiation time
!      afrac, lfrac, ifrac, and ofrac are the self-consistent values in the 
!      system. lfrin is the fraction on the land grid and is allowed to
!      vary from the self-consistent value as described below. ifrad
!      and ofrad are needed for the swnet calculation.
!  the fractions fields are defined for each grid in the fraction bundles as 
!    needed as follows.
!    character(*),parameter :: fraclist_a = 'afrac:ifrac:ofrac:lfrac:lfrin'
!    character(*),parameter :: fraclist_o = 'afrac:ifrac:ofrac:ifrad:ofrad'
!    character(*),parameter :: fraclist_i = 'afrac:ifrac:ofrac'
!    character(*),parameter :: fraclist_l = 'afrac:lfrac:lfrin'
!    character(*),parameter :: fraclist_g = 'gfrac'
!
!  we assume ocean and ice are on the same grids, same masks
!  we assume ocn2atm and ice2atm are masked maps
!  we assume lnd2atm is a global map
!  we assume that the ice fraction evolves in time but that
!    the land model fraction does not. the ocean fraction then
!    is just the complement of the ice fraction over the region
!    of the ocean/ice mask.
!  we assume that component domains are filled with the total 
!    potential mask/fraction on that grid, but that the fractions
!    sent at run time are always the relative fraction covered.
!    for example, if an atm cell can be up to 50% covered in 
!    ice and 50% land, then the ice domain should have a fraction
!    value of 0.5 at that grid cell. at run time though, the ice
!    fraction will be between 0.0 and 1.0 meaning that grid cell
!    is covered with between 0.0 and 0.5 by ice. the "relative" fractions 
!    sent at run-time are corrected by the model to be total fractions
!    such that
!  in general, on every grid,
!              fractions_*(afrac) = 1.0
!              fractions_*(ifrac) + fractions_*(ofrac) + fractions_*(lfrac) = 1.0
!  where fractions_* are a bundle of fractions on a particular grid and 
!    *frac (i.e. afrac) is the fraction of a particular component in the bundle.
!
!  the fractions are computed fundamentally as follows (although the 
!    detailed implementation might be slightly different)
!  initialization (frac_init):
!    afrac is set on all grids
!      fractions_a(afrac) = 1.0
!      fractions_o(afrac) = mapa2o(fractions_a(afrac))
!      fractions_i(afrac) = mapa2i(fractions_a(afrac))
!      fractions_l(afrac) = mapa2l(fractions_a(afrac))
!    initially assume ifrac on all grids is zero
!      fractions_*(ifrac) = 0.0
!    fractions/masks provided by surface components
!      fractions_o(ofrac) = dom_o(frac)  ! ocean "mask"
!      fractions_l(lfrin) = dom_l(frac)  ! land model fraction
!    then mapped to the atm model
!      fractions_a(ofrac) = mapo2a(fractions_o(ofrac))
!      fractions_a(lfrin) = mapl2a(fractions_l(lfrin))
!    and a few things are then derived
!      fractions_a(lfrac) = 1.0 - fractions_a(ofrac)
!        this is truncated to zero for very small values (< 0.001)
!        to attempt to preserve non-land gridcells.
!      fractions_l(lfrac) = mapa2l(fractions_a(lfrac))
!    one final term is computed
!      dom_a(ascale) = fractions_a(lfrac)/fractions_a(lfrin)
!      dom_l(ascale) = mapa2l(dom_a(ascale))
!        these are used to correct land fluxes in budgets and lnd2rtm coupling
!        and are particularly important when the land model is running on 
!        a different grid than the atm model. in the old system, this term
!        was treated as effectively 1.0 since there was always a check that
!        fractions_a(lfrac) ~ fractions_a(lfrin), namely that the land model
!        provided a land frac that complemented the ocean grid. this is
!        no longer a requirement in this new system and as a result, the
!        ascale term can be thought of as a rescaling of the land fractions
!        in the land model to be exactly complementary to the ocean model
!        on whatever grid it may be running.
!  run-time (frac_set):
!    update fractions on ice grid
!      fractions_i(ifrac) = i2x_i(Si_ifrac)  ! ice frac from ice model
!      fractions_i(ofrac) = 1.0 - fractions_i(ifrac)
!        note: the relative fractions are corrected to total fractions
!      fractions_o(ifrac) = mapi2o(fractions_i(ifrac))
!      fractions_o(ofrac) = mapi2o(fractions_i(ofrac))
!      fractions_a(ifrac) = mapi2a(fractions_i(ifrac))
!      fractions_a(ofrac) = mapi2a(fractions_i(ofrac))
! 
!  fractions used in merging are as follows
!    mrg_x2a uses fractions_a(lfrac,ofrac,ifrac)
!    mrg_x2o needs to use fractions_o(ofrac,ifrac) normalized to one
!      normalization happens in mrg routine
!
!  fraction corrections in mapping are as follows
!    mapo2a uses *fractions_o(ofrac) and /fractions_a(ofrac)
!    mapi2a uses *fractions_i(ifrac) and /fractions_a(ifrac)
!    mapl2a uses *fractions_l(lfrin) and /fractions_a(lfrin)
!    mapa2* should use *fractions_a(afrac) and /fractions_*(afrac) but this
!      has been deferred since the ratio always close to 1.0
!
!  budgets use the standard afrac, ofrac, ifrac, and lfrac to compute
!    quantities except in the land budget which uses lfrin multiplied
!    by the scale factor, dom_l(ascale) to compute budgets.
!
!  fraction and domain checks
!    initialization:
!      dom_i = mapo2i(dom_o)  ! lat, lon, mask, area
!      where fractions_a(lfrac) > 0.0, fractions_a(lfrin) is also > 0.0
!         this ensures the land will provide data everywhere the atm needs it
!         and allows the land frac to be subtly different from the
!         land fraction specified in the atm.
!      dom_a = mapl2a(dom_l)  ! if atm/lnd same grids
!      dom_a = mapo2a(dom_o)  ! if atm/ocn same grids
!      dom_a = mapi2a(dom_i)  ! if atm/ocn same grids
!      0.0-eps < fractions_*(*) < 1.0+eps
!      fractions_l(lfrin) = fractions_l(lfrac) 
!        only if atm/lnd same grids (but this is not formally required)
!        this is needed until dom_l(ascale) is sent to the land model
!        as an additional field for use in l2r mapping.
!    run time:
!      fractions_a(lfrac) + fractions_a(ofrac) + fractions_a(ifrac) ~ 1.0
!      0.0-eps < fractions_*(*) < 1.0+eps
