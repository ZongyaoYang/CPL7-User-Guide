                    <p>
                        OpenMP thread counts are controlled at three levels in CCSM4. The coarsest level
                        is prior to launching the model in the CCSM run script. The environment
                        variable OMP_NUM_THREADS is usually set to the largest value any mpi task
                        will use in CCSM4. At a minimum, this will ensure threading is turned on
                        to the maximum desired value in the run. The next level is during initialization
                        in CCSM4. When the mpi communicators are initialized, the maximum number of threads
                        per mpi task can be computed based on the ccsm_pes namelist input. At that
                        point, there is an initial fortran call to the intrinsic, omp_set_num_threads.
                        When that happens and if that call is successful, the number of threads
                        will be set to the maximum needed in the system on an mpi task by task basis.
                        Finally, there is the ability of CCSM to change the thread count per task as each
                        component is individually called and as the model integrates through the
                        driver run loop. In other words, for components that share
                        the same hardware processor but have different threads per task, this
                        feature allows those components to run with the exact value set by the user
                        in the ccsm_pes namelist. This final level of thread control is turned off by default,
                        but it can be turned on using the <a href="x371.html#nmlv_drv_threading">drv_threading</a>
                        namelist input. This fine control of threading is likely of limited use
                        at this point given the current CCSM4 driver implementation.
