                        <p>CCSM4 Driver/Coupler (Updated to drvseq3_1_20)</p>
                        <p>
                            The CCSM4 Version of the Community Climate System Model has some
                            significant changes compared to previous versions. In
                            particular, CCSM4 is NOT run via multiple executables in a
                            concurrent-only processor layout. There is now a top level
                            driver and components are called via standard init, run, and
                            finalize methods. Components can be run sequentially,
                            concurrently, or in some mixed sequential/concurrent layout on
                            processors. A coupler component that runs on a subset of the
                            total processors still exists in the system as part of the
                            driver. The driver runs on all processors and the coupler
                            functions (mapping, merging, flux calculations, and diagnostics)
                            run on a user-defined subset of the total processors. The
                            processor layout is specified at runtime via namelist inputs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the processor layout is relatively flexible and components
                            can be run sequentially or concurrently, the sequencing of the
                            science in the driver is fixed and independent of the processor
                            layout. So changing the processor layout only changes the
                            performance of the simulation system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like all components in CCSM, the driver scripting system is set
                            up such that a component template file
                            (models/drv/bld/cpl.template) is run by the ccsm configure
                            script, and it generates partially resolved cpl.buildnml.csh and
                            cpl.buildexe.csh scripts. The CCSM configure script also
                            generates case .build, .run, and .clean_build scripts. See the
                            CCSM user guide for more detailed information about this
                            process. But briefly, the process is as follows:
                        </p>
                        <pre>
 - run create_newcase to generate a case directory.
 - edit env_conf.xml and env_mach_pes.xml and then run configure -case. This 
   runs the coupler cpl.template file among other things. The configure script
   generates the .build, .run, and .clean_build scripts and
   the partially resolved buildnml and buildexe scripts in the
   Buildconf directory.
 - edit env_build.xml and run the .build script.
 - edit env_run.xml and submit the .run script.
    </pre>
