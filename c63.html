                        <h3 id="implementation_time_general">Driver Clocks</h3>
                        <p>
                            The CCSM4 driver manages the main clock in the system. That clock
                            advances at the shortest coupling period and uses alarms to trigger
                            component coupling and other events. In addition, the driver maintains
                            a clock that is associated with each component. The driver's component
                            clocks have a timestep associated with <a href="c63.html#implementation_time_coupling">
                                the coupling period of that
                                component</a>. The main driver clock and the component clocks in the driver
                            advance in a coordinated manor and are always synchronized.
                            The advancement of time is managed as follows in the main run loop. First,
                            the main driver clock advances one timestep and the component clocks are
                            advanced in a synchronous fashion. The clock time represents the time
                            at the end of the next model timestep. Alarms may be triggered at that timestep
                            to call the the atmosphere, land, sea ice, land ice, or ocean run methods.
                            If a component run alarm is triggered, the run method is called and
                            the driver passes that component's clock to that component. The component clock
                            contains information about the length of the next component integration and
                            the expected time of the component at the end of the integration period.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Generally, the component models have indepedent time management
                            software. When a component run method is called, the component must
                            advance the proper period and also check that their internal clock is
                            consistent with the coupling clock before returning to the driver.
                            The clock passed to the component by the driver contains this information.
                            Component models are also responsible for making sure the coupling
                            period is consistent with their internal timestep. History files are
                            managed independently by each component, but restart files are
                            coordinated by the driver (see <a href="x156.html">the Section called <i>History and Restart
                                    Files</i></a>).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The clocks in CCSM4 are based on the ESMF clock datatype are are
                            supported in software by either an official ESMF library or by
                            software included in CCSM called esmf_wrf_timemgr. The esmf_wrf_timemgr
                            software is a much simplified Fortran implementation of a subset
                            of the ESMF time manager interfaces.

                            <h2 id="implementation_time_loop">The Driver Time Loop</h2>

                            <p>
                                The driver time loop is hardwired to
                                <a href="x26.html#design_seq">sequence the component models</a>
                                in a specific way to meet scientific requirements and to provide the maximum possible
                                concurrency of work.
                                The results of the model integration are not dependent on the processor layout of the
                                components.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The driver is configured to couple the atmosphere, land, and sea ice models using the
                                same coupling frequency,
                                while the ocean model may be coupled at the same or a lower frequency.
                                To support this, the driver performs temporal averaging of coupling inputs to the ocean
                                and computes the surface ocean albedo at the higher frequency.
                                No averaging is done for other component interactions; land and sea ice surface albedos
                                are calculated within their respective components.
                                Additional functionality could be added to support alternative coupling schemes, but
                                this would require careful handling of the interaction between albedo calculations and
                                atmospheric radiation.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The coupler processors (PEs) manage data exchange between components.
                                Tasks include deriving fields, transferring data to/from components, and executing
                                component models.
                                The time loop proceeds as follows:
                            </p>

                            <pre>

Ocean inputs are accumulated; atmosphere/ocean fluxes are computed.
Land data is sent back to the coupler.
Ice data is sent back to the coupler.
Atmospheric forcing data is computed.
Atmospheric data is rearranged to atmosphere PEs.
The atmosphere model is run.
Atmospheric data is returned to the coupler.
Ocean data is returned to the coupler.
The loop returns.
  </pre>

                            <p>
                                Within this loop, operations like mapping, merging, diagnostics, area corrections, and
                                flux computations are overlapped with component execution when possible.
                                The land ice model is not included in the above sequence as its coupling design is still
                                under development, and it will likely operate on a much longer timescale.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The sequencing strategy in CCSM4 has evolved over two decades to ensure conservation of
                                mass and heat, minimize lags, and maintain system stability.
                                This design aligns with concurrency limitations discussed
                                <a href="x26.html#design_seq">here</a>.
                                Land and sea ice models always run before the atmospheric model, while the coupler and
                                ocean models can run concurrently with other components.
                                The atmosphere, land, sea ice, and atmosphere/ocean flux steps are not lagged; however,
                                the ocean state is lagged by one ocean coupling period.
                                See more details <a href="x162.html">here</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You can reduce the ocean lag by setting the namelist variable
                                <a href="x371.html#nmlv_ocean_tight_coupling">ocean_tight_coupling</a> to true.
                                This changes the step where ocean data is sent back to the coupler so it occurs earlier
                                in the loop — before the flux computation — reducing the lag by one atmosphere coupling
                                period.
                                However, it also limits the ability for the ocean and atmosphere models to run
                                concurrently.
                                This setting is most useful when the ocean coupling frequency matches the other
                                components.

                            <h2 id="implementation_time_coupling">Coupling Frequency</h2>

                            <p>
                                In the current implementation, the coupling period must be identical for the atmosphere,
                                sea ice, and land components. The ocean coupling period can be the same or greater. All
                                coupling periods must be multiple integers of the smallest coupling period and should
                                evenly divide a day of time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The coupling periods are set in the driver namelist for each component via variables
                                called something like <code>atm_cpl_dt</code> and <code>atm_cpl_offset</code>. The units
                                of these inputs are seconds. The coupler template file derives these values from CCSM4
                                script variable names like <code>ATM_NCPL</code> which is the coupling frequency per
                                day. The <code>*_cpl_dt</code> input specifies the coupling period in seconds and the
                                <code>*_cpl_offset</code> input specifies the temporal offset of the coupling time
                                relative to initial time. An example of an offset might be a component that couples
                                every six hours. That would normally be on the 6th, 12th, 18th, and 24th hour of every
                                day. An offset of 3600 seconds would change the coupling to the 1st, 7th, 13th, and 19th
                                hour of every day. The offsets cannot be larger than the coupling period and the sign of
                                the offsets is such that a positive offset shifts the alarm time forward by that number
                                of seconds. The offsets are of limited use right now because of the limitations of the
                                relative coupling frequencies.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Offsets play an important role in supporting concurrency. There is an offset of the
                                smallest coupling period automatically introduced in every coupling run alarm for each
                                component clock. This is only mentioned because it is an important but subtle point of
                                the implementation and changing the coupling offset could have an impact on concurrency
                                performance. Without this explicit automatic offset, the component run alarms would
                                trigger at the end of the coupling period. This is fine for components that are running
                                at the shortest coupling period, but will limit the ability of models to run
                                concurrently for models that couple at longer periods. What is really required for
                                concurrency is that the run alarm be triggered as early as possible and that the data
                                not be copied from that component to the coupler pes until the coupling period has
                                ended. The detailed implementation of this feature is documented in the
                                <code>seq_timemgr_mod.F90</code> file and the impact of it for the ocean coupling is
                                implemented in the <code>ccsm_driver.F90</code> code via use of the
                                <code>ocnrun_alarm</code> and <code>ocnnext_alarm</code> variables.
